                <strong>Personal Background:</strong> Hi! My name is Neel Panajkar, and I live in Cary. I'm here at UNCC
                studying Computer
                Science. I love to play video games, play/watch soccer, and eat good food.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Professional Background:</strong> I haven't worked a full-time job per se, but I have had some
                summer internships in the past. My most recent one was last summer, where I worked at a company called
                Dayforce (previously Ceridian).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Academic Background:</strong> I came to college straight from my high school (Apex High School)
                to UNCC, where I'm a Computer Science major.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I've gained most of my programming experience before I came
                to college. I've been coding in Python for a while now, but coming to university, I've been learning
                other programming languages as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> I mainly program on my MacBook, as that's what I've been
                using all the time, and so far, it has never failed me üëç.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Courses I'm Taking and Why:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 3160 - Database Design and Implementation:</strong> I'm taking this course as it is
                        required for my degree and also a good refresher, as in my internship this summer, I've coded in
                        SQL while also challenging my SQL skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 3135 - Web Applications Development:</strong> I'm taking this course as it's
                        required for my degree, but I'm also taking it because I really want to learn how to develop web
                        pages and web apps.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 3146 - Intro Operating Systems and Networking:</strong> I am taking this course as
                        it's not only required but also important, as I get to learn more about TCP/UDP networks, the
                        OSI model, the various routing protocols, and much more.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITCS 3112 - Design and Imp Object-Oriented System:</strong> I am taking this course as
                        it's not only required but also important, as I get to design a solution that utilizes the
                        various programming skills in Java I've learned so far, like the implementation of interfaces,
                        abstraction, and inheritance.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 3688 - Computers and Their Impact on Society:</strong> I am taking this course as
                        it's not only required but also important, as I get to learn about the different ways computers
                        have an impact on our society.</li>
