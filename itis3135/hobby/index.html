            <h2>About the Beautiful Game</h2>
            <p>
                The beautiful game as we all know it lays its origins back in the early 19th century. Although there
                were
                many different versions of the game spread among various different countries, the origins of the
                game, however, come from England.

            </figure>
            <p>
                Fast forward a bit to the mid-19th century where we find that football branched itself into two main
                categories: <b>Futsal</b> and <b>Beach</b> football.
            </p>
            <p>
                Futsal is an indoor version of soccer and can be played on indoor turf or a regular high-school gym
                floor.

            <h2>Best Times</h2>
            <p>
                Ahhh. The best times in football. Getting to watch your favorite team show up on the big occasions and
                win the big trophies. As you may know there are many teams in football, yet the team I chose to
                support is a team called FC Barcelona a.k.a Barca. FC Barcelona are a team that play their football in
                Spain under the league La Liga. La Liga is made up of 20 teams that all fight for the European spots
                (the top 6 spots). The top 4 spots get placed into a competition called the Champions League, leagues
                from all over Europe have deteremined that teams that finish in their top x spots get placed into this
                competition. This competition is no easy competition to win, Barca have won this competition
                5 times (1992, 2006, 2009, 2011, and 2015). They have not managed to win ever since ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

            </figure>
            <p>
                The World Cup... An absolute cracking competition that's even better than the Champions League and MUCH
                MUCH harder to win. If the Champions League is played with teams across Europe than what would be the
                format for this ? The World Cup, played every 4 years, is played amongst countries and football players
                are called up to their countries World Cup squad (a total of 26 players) based on the country of birth.
                Various countries go head to head in a 48 'team' format, where there are 12 pots with 4 teams each and
                the top 3 teams from each pot advance into group stages who then advance into the quarter finals, semi
                finals, and finally the final. The competition was first introduced 1930 and was first hosted in Uruguay
                where the host country actually ended up winning the competition. The country with the most World Cup
                wins in history is Brazil with a total of 5 wins. Fun fact, there are only 8 countries ever to win the
                World Cup

                Watching a football match, though, WHEW !!, is a whole another ball game. Watching the game live in a
                stadium is the best feeling. In a crowd of thousands and thousands of people, the flood lights
                illuminating the field, the adrenaline rush you feel when your team scores a goal, makes a defensive
                tackle, or even wins the whole game, is just a different feeling all together.
