            <h2>About the Beautiful Game</h2>
            <p>
                The beautiful game as we all know it lays its origins back in the early 19th century. Although there
                were
                many different versions of the game spread among various different countries, the origins of the
                game, however, come from England.

            </figure>
            <p>
                Fast forward a bit to the mid-19th century where we find that football branched itself into two main
                categories: <b>Futsal</b> and <b>Beach</b> football.
            </p>
            <p>
                Futsal is an indoor version of soccer and can be played on indoor turf or a regular high-school gym
                floor.

            <h2>Best Times</h2>
            <p>
                Ahhh. The best times in football. Getting to watch your favorite team show up on the big occasions and
                win the big trophies. As you may know there are many teams in football, yet the team I chose to
                support is a team called FC Barcelona a.k.a Barca. FC Barcelona are a team that play their football in
                Spain under the league La Liga. La Liga is made up of 20 teams that all fight for the European spots
                (the top 6 spots). The top 4 spots get placed into a competition called the Champions League, leagues
                from all over Europe have deteremined that teams that finish in their top x spots get placed into this
                competition. This competition is no easy competition to win, Barca have won this competition
                5 times (1992, 2006, 2009, 2011, and 2015). They have not managed to win ever since ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

            </figure>
            <p>
                The World Cup... An absolute cracking competition that's even better than the Champions League and MUCH
                MUCH harder to win. If the Champions League is played with teams across Europe than what would be the
                format for this ?That's right. Countries. The World Cup, played every 4 years, is played amongst
                countries and football players are called up to their countries World Cup squad (a total of 26 players)
                based on the country of birth. Various countries go head to head in a 48 'team' format, where there are
                12 pots with 4 teams each and the top 3 teams from each pot advance into group stages who then advance
                into the quarter finals, semi finals, and finally the final. The competition was first introduced 1930
                and was first hosted in Uruguay where the host country actually ended up winning the competition. The
                country with the most World Cup wins in history is Brazil with a total of 5 wins. Fun fact, there are
                only 8 countries ever to win the World Cup

                Watching a football match, though, WHEW !!, is a whole another ball game. Watching the game live in a
                stadium is the best feeling in the world. In a crowd of thousands and thousands of people, the flood
                lights illuminating the field, the adrenaline rush you feel when your team scores a goal, makes a
                defensive tackle, or even wins the whole game, is just a different feeling all together.

            <h2>How</h2>
            <p>
                To play football, you just need some football boots (soccer cleats), a goal post, some cones (if you're
                thinking of running some drills), and a football. If you do end up playing an official game then its
                imperative that you know the rules of the game.
            </p>

            <p>
                With 11 players on the pitch your coach decides the best formation for your team which optimizes the
                attack as well as creates a rock solid defence with a midfield that can dictate the tempo of the game.
                The game starts with both teams picking a captain and then each of those captains (dictated by a coin
                flip) decides whether they want the ball first or pick the which side they want

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>For me, football is more than just a game; it's a way of life. It's a source of inspiration, motivation,
                and connection. It's a reminder that through teamwork, dedication, and a shared love for the sport, we
                can achieve great things.</p>
